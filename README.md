# eXecutive - The Trader for Single-Player Tarkov Project  

The eXecutive trader Anton - whose character prototype is based on Gaijin Entertainment's co-founder Anton Yudintsev (creator of *War Thunder* , *Enlisted* and other MMO titles) - will guide you through an immersive storyline featuring over 30 gaijined quests.  

## Future Development Roadmap:  
1. **Custom Recipes**  
Unlockable through quest progression, offering tiered crafting enhancements.  

2. **Cross-Franchise Items**  
Assets from Gaijin's game (including *War Thunder* and *Enlisted* ) with lore-consistent implementation (Re-textured).  

3. **New weapons**  
Introducing firearms via new asset bundles.  

This mod is scheduled for release with full multilingual support (Simplified Chinese / English), featuring linguistically validated UI elements and quest dialogue localization.
